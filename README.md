## Novel Font Scene Text (NFST) Dataset

As scene texts in novel font styles only make up a small proportion in existing benchmarks, we collect 100 text images with novel or unusual font styles to form a new dataset named as the Novel Font Scene Text (NFST) dataset ([download link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Actasidiot/EFIFSTR/master/NFST.zip)).

We compare our method with other two state-of-the-art methods ([ASTER](https://github.com/bgshih/aster) and [SAR](https://github.com/wangpengnorman/SAR-Strong-Baseline-for-Text-Recognition)) whose codes are publicly available. Our method significantly outperforms others on this dataset (see the following table), whose robustness to font style variance is proved.

## Prerequisites

 **TensorFlow r1.15**.



## Installation
  1. Go to `c_ops/` and run `build.sh` to build the custom operators
  2. Execute `protoc aster/protos/*.proto --python_out=.` to build the protobuf files
  3. Add `/path/to/aster` to `PYTHONPATH`, or set this variable for every run
